# Haskell2Julia

H2J is a mini-transpiler (written in Julia) capable of translating a subset of the Haskell language into Julia. 

The source code for the transpiler exists in the Jupyter Notebook - H2J_main.ipynb , along with extensive documentation. 

The transpiler is a work in progress, but it has enough functionality to be semi-useful. 


H2J requirements: 
==================
Julia = 1.3.1

Jupyter Notebook = 5.7.8
