# Haskell2Julia

H2J is a mini-transpiler (written in Julia) capable of translating a subset of the Haskell language into Julia. 

The source code for the transpiler exists in the Jupyter Notebook - H2J_main.ipynb , along with extensive documentation. 

The transpiler in its current form was an exericse to see how quickly a crude working transpiler could be written. 
H2J has enough functionality to be semi-useful, but the code will be rewritten so that incorporates more sound compiler design principles.
Please check the "Projects" tab for updates to H2J.
